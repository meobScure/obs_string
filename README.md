# Custom String Library (C Implementation)

This repository contains a custom implementation of various string manipulation functions in C. These functions aim to replicate or mimic the behavior of standard library functions, offering an opportunity to explore and understand their inner workings.

## Features

- Custom implementations for common string functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strcmp`, and more.
- Error handling with custom error messages for specific error codes.
- Utility functions for memory manipulation and error description.

## Disclaimer

This library is a personal project and **may not be optimized for performance or memory usage**. Contributions are welcome to help improve the code quality and efficiency.

## Contribution

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you:

- Spot bugs or incorrect behavior in any function.
- Have suggestions for improving the code or adding new features.
- Want to optimize existing implementations.

## Usage

Include the header file in your C project:

```c
#include "obs_string_lib.h"
